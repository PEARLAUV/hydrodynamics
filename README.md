#hydrodyamics

PEARL hydrodynamics module  
1. Omegacheck  
*Find the natural frequency in any DOF
2. Addedmassplot  
*Plot added mass of any DOF
3. PEARLRAOalldof  
*Find/plot frequency vs RAO for any DOF
4. Hydro_coefficient  
*Find mass matrix, hydrostatic coefficient, added mass, radiation damping coeff  
5. PEARL_animate  
*Animates PEARL in the water using RAO  
*(Problem with mesh - the object itself is expanding)

Note: .stl files are in the drive for PEARL.
