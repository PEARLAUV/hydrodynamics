# hydrodynamics
PEARL hydrodynamics module
Omegacheck  
 Find the natural frequency in any DOF
Addedmassplot   
 Plot added mass of any DOF
PEARLRAOalldof  
  Find/plot frequency vs RAO for any DOF
Hydro_coefficient  
  Find mass matrix, hydrostatic coefficient, added mass, radiation damping coeff
PEARL_animate  
  Animates PEARL in the water using RAO
  ***Problem with mesh â€“ the object itself is expanding
